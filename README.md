# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

The assignment's requirements were to render a table onto an html page from a json data file, which can be filtered dynamically using JavaScript. Therefore, to complete this project, the following considerations were taken into account:

1. initialization which start with table rendering using forEach loop to generate html rows;
2. autocomplete dropdown list, which shows all possible values from the table view;
3. dynamic rendering as values are submited into the input fields;
4. button to clear all filters and re-render the initial table.
